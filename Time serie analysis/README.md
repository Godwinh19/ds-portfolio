# Time serie analysis
***Making forecast with time serie. contains notes***

* Notes takes from [Here](https://www.bounteous.com/insights/2020/09/15/forecasting-time-series-model-using-python-part-one/)

For model-comparaison-sarima-lstm-prophet, we have : 
| Models  | MEAN | RMSE  Errors  | MSE  Errors|
| :-------------: | :------------- | :-------------: | :-------------: |
|  SARIMA  |  148.42 |  8.14  | 66.18  |
|  LSTM  |  148.42 |  10.77  | 116.02  |
|  SARIMA  |  148.42 |  11.48  | 131.69  |

* Then SARIMA fit well (with simple tuning) to the monthly beer production dataset.
